# UBC_MDS_application
Dear UBC MDS search members:

Please find my application to the Postdoctoral Teaching and Learning Fellowâ€“UBC Master of Data Science program attached.
* CV
* Cover letter
* Teaching Statement
* List of reference
* Sample teaching materials (please note that many of the course GitHub repos that I am working on are set private by UMich, so I can only share a sample teaching notebook instead of the entire repo)

Sincerely,
 
Quan Nguyen, Ph.D.
